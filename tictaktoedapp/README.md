# Tic Tac Toe Game Documentation

## 1. Introduction
This documentation outlines the architecture and flow of a Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js for the frontend, IPFS via Pinata for decentralized storage, and Solidity for blockchain integration. The game allows users to play online, tracks game progress locally, and securely stores game data on IPFS and the blockchain.

## 2. Flow Overview
- **User Interaction**: Users interact with the game through the React.js frontend.
- **Local Storage**: Game data (such as moves and actions) is temporarily stored in the local storage of the user's browser.
- **Game Completion**: After a game finishes, the local storage is cleared.
- **IPFS Storage**: The game data is then securely stored on IPFS via Pinata, generating a unique hash value for the data.
- **Blockchain Integration**: The hash value is stored on the blockchain using Solidity smart contracts, ensuring immutability and transparency of game records.

## 3. Frontend Flow
- **User Interaction**: Players interact with the game interface rendered using React.js.
- **Game Progress Tracking**: React.js tracks all user actions, such as moves and game completion.
- **Local Storage**: Game data is stored locally in the user's browser using browser storage APIs (e.g., localStorage).
- **Game Completion Detection**: When a game finishes, the local storage is cleared to prepare for the next game.

## 4. Backend Flow
- **IPFS Storage**: After game completion, the game data is uploaded to IPFS via the Pinata API, ensuring decentralized and secure storage.
- **Hash Retrieval**: Pinata returns a unique hash value representing the stored game data.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Using Solidity smart contracts deployed on the blockchain, the hash value is stored permanently, ensuring the integrity and transparency of game records.
- **Blockchain Transaction**: A transaction is executed to store the hash value on the blockchain, providing a permanent record of the game data.

## 5. Game Data Structure
- The game data stored includes information such as player moves, game outcome, timestamps, and any other relevant metadata.
- This data is structured in a format suitable for IPFS storage and blockchain transactions.

## 6. Security Considerations
- Data stored on IPFS is encrypted to ensure privacy and security.
- Smart contracts are audited for security vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of game records.

## 7. Deployment
- The frontend is deployed on a web server accessible to users.
- IPFS nodes and Pinata API are utilized for decentralized storage.
- Solidity smart contracts are deployed on a compatible blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum).

## 8. Conclusion
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture and flow of the Tic Tac Toe game, demonstrating the integration of React.js frontend with IPFS and Solidity smart contracts for decentralized storage and blockchain integration. By following this flow, users can securely play the game online while ensuring the integrity and transparency of game records.
